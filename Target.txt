1. All yelpdata => Grade
2. All grades => yelp rating
3. what violations contribute most for the grades
=> not about the score, but the relations. ex: if violating A3D, you may got an B.
4. Is some grading too harsh?
=> if you get a violation that are possibly to have a rank A but you don't, maybe it is too harsh this time.
5. Is some yelp rating too biased?


Cleaning:
INSPECTION_TYPE: ignore reopening and non-operational
recover missing grades from inspection_date and restaurant


For decision tree:
category => Vector(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)

For vio_code => grade:
grade (A, B, C) = (3,4,6)

violation => yelp rating
viocode => 4.5
viocode => price
viocode => review_count
viocode => food category (in yelp)
